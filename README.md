#### Hi, I'm Mihou! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-proclaimed full-stack developer with a specific love for backend development from the Bohol, Philippines. I'm currently primarily a Kotlin developer with Typescript, Svelte and Rust to create backends and frontends respectively. I plan to participate more in local meetups from where I am, so if you find me out there, feel free to hit me up! I'm more than happy to expand on my knowledge for things, therefore, if you have a particular stack, language or even tool that you want to recommend, come at me!

#### about me
- i'm eighteen years old at the time of writing, and am currently attending a local high school.
- i used to, and maybe still, write webnovels.
- mangas, webtoons and comics are the epitome of me.
- creating minimalistic graphics tends to be my hobby.
- i'm a photographer who also loves to make cinematographs!
- i have a deep curiosity for anything that excites me, that's how i got into all my hobbies and even programming.
- i'm not human.

#### proud projects
some projects that i am proud of.
- [exponie.me](https://exponie.me): i was about to participate a spelling contest, but had no tool to help me practice... so i made one.
- [mana](https://github.com/ManaNet/): a discontinued discord bot that was the fuel for the start of my programming life.
- [nexus](https://github.com/ShindouMihou/Nexus): a kotlin-java discord framework for javacord that aims to be beautiful.
- [amelia](https://github.com/Amelia-chan/Amelia): a rss discord bot that was built for scribblehub.

##### legacy projects
some even older projects that haven't been updated for some time now and can be improved way more.
- [celestia](https://github.com/ShindouMihou/celestia): a logging stack that i used in production once for [mana](https://github.com/ManaNet) to trace errors and logs.
- [youdiary](https://github.com/ShindouMihou/youdiary): a personal diary written in sveltekit and typescript that is used to store personal notes.
- [velen](https://github.com/ShindouMihou/velen): the predecessor to [nexus](https://github.com/ShindouMihou/Nexus).
- [rua](https://github.com/ShindouMihou/Rua): a simple rust reddit scraper.
- [rosedb](https://github.com/ShindouMihou/RoseDB): one curious attempt at making a bad "database".
